# Audio-Watermarking-using-FFT
An audio watermark is a unique electronic identifier embedded in an audio signal, typically used to identify ownership of copyright. It is similar to a watermark on a photograph.

Watermarking is the process of embedding information into a signal (e.g. audio, video or pictures) in a way that is difficult to remove. 
If the signal is copied, then the information is also carried in the copy. 
Watermarking has become increasingly important to enable copyright protection and ownership verification.
This project will enable the user to embed any file, either a vector or an image into the audio signal.
The detection part will simply print the detectedd watermark.
